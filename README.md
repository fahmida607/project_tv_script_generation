# project_tv_script_generation
Built a system for pre-processing text in the TV script of “Seinfeld” dataset and constructed TV script generator using a LSTM network with word embedding in PyTorch and trained the model on the “Seinfeld” dataset with hyper parameter tuning to achieve a “Categorical Cross Entropy” loss of 3.24 for vocabulary size of 21388 in training set for script generation. For embadding purporse. had to create a lookup table where integers were turned into vocab and vocav were turned into integers. Then punctuation were tokenized. after that batching data were set, feature and target tensor were created using TensotDataset and tensor Dataloader. Implementing RNN using PyTorch module where LSTM was choosed and for RNN __init__, init_hidden and forward propagation function were implemented.
